Task 0
O(1)
The output is constant and is not dependent on the size of the input.

Task 1

O(N)
The output is dependent on the size of the input and iterates over the entire
list of calls and texts once, hence it is O(N).

Task 2

O(N)
To group the list of calls by the numbers into a dictionary data structure, the complexity is O(N)input.
Once the list is present giving the information of 
"phone_number" : amount of time spent in the call in seconds
To retrieve the phone number that has the maximum talktime , the list is iterated over.
So, total complexity is O(N).

Task 3

O(N) + O(NlogN) = O(NlogN)
Based on the input , we iterate over the list and create a dictionary data structure
When sorting the list of keys , the complexity is O(NlogN)

Task 4

O(NlogN)
Based on the input , we iterate over the list and create a list and remove duplicates using the set data structure.
When sorting the list, the complexity is O(NlogN)
